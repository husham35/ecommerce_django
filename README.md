## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Stripe account for payments (dev environment keys)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-website.git
   cd ecommerce-website
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database:**

   - Create a PostgreSQL database:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
     ```

   - Update `DATABASES` in `ecommerce/settings.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials:

     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
             'NAME': 'ecommerce_db',
             'USER': 'your_username',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '5432',
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Apply Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the Server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Now, the app should be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Running the Application

- **Login**: Use `/accounts/login/` to log in to the system.
- **Register**: Use `/accounts/signup/` to create a new user account.
- **Admin**: The Django admin interface is available at `/admin/`.

## Database

PostgreSQL is used as the database for this application. All models are located in the `products` and `accounts` apps.

### Key Models

- **Product**: Represents items available for sale.
- **Category**: Represents product categories (e.g., electronics, kitchen).
- **Order**: Represents customer orders.
- **Wishlist**: Represents the wishlist items for each user.

## Stripe Integration

Stripe is integrated to handle secure payments. To test payments:

1. Create a Stripe account and get the test keys from the dashboard.
2. Update `settings.py` with your Stripe keys:

   ```python
   STRIPE_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY = "your_test_public_key"
   STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY = "your_test_secret_key"
   ```

3. Test payments in the checkout flow.

## HTMX for Dynamic UI

HTMX is used to create dynamic and responsive UI components, such as:

- **Updating the cart**: Items are added/removed from the cart without refreshing the page.
- **Wishlist**: Products can be added to the wishlist dynamically.

## Wishlist Feature

Each user can manage their own wishlist, adding or removing products. This feature is built into the userâ€™s profile section and integrated with the HTMX dynamic UI framework.

## Admin Dashboard

Only admin users have access to the custom admin dashboard. Here, they can:

- Manage products (create, update, delete).
- View and manage customer orders.
- Access customer data for user management.
